class Annotations(MassSpecReader):
    """Create/store/read annotations from uniprot and figure out entry names

    The Annotations classes allows one to populate the dataframe attribute
    :attr:`df` with the **Entry** and **Entry_name**  columns (UniProt entries).
    This is not strictly speaking required columns but provide more tools if
    available. The annotations also creates a new dataframe called :attr:`annotations`
    that stores in particular the protein sequence and the GO terms. The former
    being used to check the peptide sequence and the latter to plot relevant
    histogram about GO terms.

    This class inherits from :class:`msdas.readers.MassSpecReader`. Consequently,
    input can be a MassSpecReader instance, or a filename or even nothing (data
    can be read at a later stage). The dataframe must contain the Protein column.

    One reason to fetch the entries from UniProt is that the protein column name
    may contain typos or non-uniprot entries, therefore it is quite useful to
    fetch all entries from uniprot based on the protein name provided. This can
    be done thanks to the :meth:`get_uniprot_entries`. This method fills a dictionary called
    :attr:`_mapping` (note the underscore), which is used to populate a new column
    in the dataframe called **Entry**.

    If your initial dataframe contains the columns "Entry" with all valid UniProt
    entries (e.g., P23300) then the :attr:`_mapping` attribute is populated during the
    initialisation and the call to :meth:`get_uniprot_entries` can be skipped.
    If called, it will also be faster but will overwrite the content of the Entry column.
    You can also fill/correct/complete the :attr:`_mapping` attribute before calling
    :meth:`get_uniprot_entries`

    .. doctest::

        >>> from msdas import annotations
        >>> import pandas as pd
        >>> df = pd.DataFrame({
            'Protein':['DIG1'],
            'Sequence_Phospho':['SS(Phospho)T'],
            'Psite':['S2']})
        >>> a = annotations.Annotations(df, "YEAST")
        >>> a._mapping
        {}
        >>> a.get_uniprot_entries()
        {'DIG1_YEAST': ['Q03063']}
        >>> a.df.Entry
        0    Q03063
        Name: Entry, dtype: object

    Then, call :meth:`set_annotations`, which will fetch all annotations from
    uniprot and store them in a new dataframe in the :attr:`annotations` attribute

    ::

        a.set_annotations()
        a.annotations

    A new field called **Entry_name** is also added to the dataframe itself::

        a.df.Entry_name

    On a big data set, it may take a few minutes to fetch all information from uniprot.
    So, we also provide tools to save and read back the relevant information (
    :meth:`read_annotations`, :meth:`to_pickle`, :meth:`to_csv`  ) ::

        from msdas import *
        r = readers.MassSpecReader(get_yeast_raw_data())
        # this takes about 10 minutes depending on the connection for 1600 unique protein names
        a.get_uniprot_entries()
        a.set_annotations()
        a.to_pickle(tag="test") # creates a file called YEAST_annotations_test.pkl
        a.to_csv("data.csv")

    Next time, just type::

        from msdas import *
        a = annotations.Annotations("data.csv", "YEAST")
        a.read_annotations("YEAST_annotations_test.pkl")

    To check that the entries are correct, one thing that can be done is to
    look for the peptide sequence into the FASTA sequence found in the annotations::

        a.check_entries_versus_sequence()

    This is a very good sanity check to verify that the entry names found
    correspond to the peptide provided. If not, the protein name was probably wrong
    or was a gene name that could not be mapped correctly to the correct protein.

    If some entries are not found or mapping was not found, you need to
    manually check the issues and update the :attr:`_mapping` attribute,
    update the uniprot entries and annotations::

        a._mapping[entry] = ['entry name']
        a.get_uniprot_entries()
        a.set_annotations()
        a.check_entries_versus_sequence()

    if you cannot find a mapping, we would recommend to delete the item from
    the dataframe :attr:`df`.

        """Search for the uniprot entries and entry names given protein column.

        Protein names from the dataframe are first used to feed uniprot mapping tool.
        Some protein names won't be found as a uniprot entry because there are
        not uniprot entry name but gene names.  We therefore also scan
        missing entries by looking for gene names. Once found, the proposed
        items that contain the gene names and organism are candidates for the
        entry names. There may be several solutions though, which explain why
        the values in the :attr:`_mapping` dictionary  are made of lists. If several
        candidates are found, warning and raised.

        Results are stored in :attr:`_mapping` and in the dataframe itself.

        Let us show one example with 3 protein names that cover all cases:

            * DIG1, is a valid uniprot entry
            * ASC1 is not a uniprot entry. It is a gene name from which the entry
              may be retrieved automatically.
            * LEU1 is a gene name AND a uniprot entry. This is an ambiguous
              case. The default is to use the uniprot entry but if you call
              :meth:`check_entries_versus_sequence` (after meth:`set_annotations`)
              you will see that there is a mismatch meaning that LEU1_YEAST provided
              in the protein column is catually not the protein name but the gene name


        ::

            >>> import pandas as pd
            >>> from msdas import *
            >>> df = pd.DataFrame({'Protein':['DIG1', 'LEU1', 'ASC1'],
                'Sequence_Phospho':['S(Phospho)APAQVTQHSK', 'VEVTS(Phospho)EDEK',
                                    'DS(Phospho)VTIISAGNDK'],
                'Psite':['S142','S495', 'S166']})
            >>> a = Annotations(df, "YEAST)
            >>> a.get_uniprot_entries()
            >>> a._mapping
            {'ASC1_YEAST': ['P38011', 'P01120'],
             'DIG1_YEAST': ['Q03063'],
             'LEU1_YEAST': ['P06208-1', 'P06208']}

        Here, DIG1 has one unique entry. This is expected because DIG1 is in fact
        an entry name (unique by definition). ASC1 is a gene name. This method
        figures out that it correspond to either P38011 or P01120. There are
        several entries because mapping from gene to protein is not unique.
        By default, the entry with highest score appears first. There is no 100% guarantee
        that this mapping is correct and :meth:`check_entries_versus_sequence`
        should be called to check that the peptide sequence is contained in
        this entry sequence. The last case (LEU1) is even more problematic because
        it is a valid entry name even though the protein name provided is actually
        a gene name... again call :meth:`check_entries_versus_sequence`.


            >>> a.set_annotations()
            >>> a.check_entries_versus_sequence()
            P06208-1 not found in the annotations index

        So, here we are told that amongst the 3 entries, P06208-1 is not found.
        This the LEU1 case. If you were to use batch tool, you would figure out
        given the peptide sequence that this is actually LEUC_YEAST entry with
        uniprot entry LEUC_YEAST/P07264.

        So, you need to manually update the mapping:

            >>> a._mapping['LEU1_YEAST'] = ['P07264']
            >>> a.get_uniprot_entries() # to update the main df with new entries
            >>> a.set_annotations() # to retrieve the sequence of LEUC_YEAST
            >>> a.check_entries_versus_sequence()

        .. seealso:: :meth:`set_annotations`

    is also a valid entry name or because the gene maps to several entry names.
    This list gives some of these ambiguities. The first one is used by default

        * FLO9 1004^554^464^374^T329^T779, T(Phospho)GTFTSTSTEM(Oxidation)TTVTGTNGQPTDETVIVI should be T779
        * One entry is AD5;7 which is wrongly named to not clash with CSV format. The proper
          name is indeed AD5,7. We renamed it in the file as PUR2_YEAST. We checked the sequence
        * To find the mapping, we used blast from bioservices to figure out the sequence of
          the protein and checked on uniprot. See update_mapping function
        * Typo in the original code for ABP1 peptide: small e was found.
          KEPVKT eSP APAAK should be KEPVKT PSP APAAK
        * Possible typo is STE11_S323 location  should be S326
        * Also possible typoe IMP2 has 2 rows called IMP2' (note the quote)


    Here are proteins names provided in the Yeast_data_set that are actually gene
    names. Using bioservices, we figure out possible uniprot entries but similarlly
    to the YEF3 there is maybe an ambiguity on the name::

        77 P54114 ALD4   could be ALDH4_YEAST ([') whereas P54114 is ALD3
        2077 P23638 PRS5    KPR5_YEAST  '
        6664 P01120 ASC1  GBLP_YEAST  P38011

    there are 6 peptide labelled CTR9. In fact, it is 2 different peptides. first 4 are CTR9
    2 last are EAMAISEHNVKDDSDLSDKDNEYDEEQPR . This is defintely CTR9 but is not exactly in
    the sequence. Missing K at the end

    SIR1_YEAST exists but the peptide sequence  cannot be found either using blast or manual searh on uniprot
    possibly sirp1 but not yeast organism; it is yeasb. Actually may still be SIR1
    but Uniprot changed the sequence. See persona communicatoin with uniprot.
