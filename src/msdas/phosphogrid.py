    You need first a list of protein names that you are interested in.
    This list can be obtained from the merger instance as follows::

        from msdas import *
        m = MassSpecReader(get_yeast_small_data, "yeast")
        gene_names = set(list(m.df.Protein))

    Then, you can use this class as follows to visualise and save into a SIF file the
    network built from phosphogrid database.

    .. plot::
        :include-source:
        :width: 70%

        >>> from msdas import *
        >>> r = MassSpecReader(get_yeast_small_data())
        >>> gene_names = set(list(r.df.Protein))
        >>> p = phosphogrid.PhosphoGRID()
        >>> p.run(gene_names=gene_names)
        >>> p.export2sif()
        >>> p.plot()

    2 databases are used. Their filenames are hard coded as:

        #. BIOGRID-PTM-RELATIONSHIPS-3.1.93.ptmrel.txt
        #. BIOGRID-PTM-15-3.1.93.ptmtab.txt
