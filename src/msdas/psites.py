    """Utilities to manipulate and validate phosphorylation sites (psites) encoding

    Psites stands for phosphorylation sites. There are encoded in different w
    ays depending on the input data files. This class
    provides methods to help decipher the different format and convert them
    into a common one.

    Psites indicate the position of a phosphorylation on a given sequence of
    amino acids as well as the amino acid on which the phosphorylation occured. For
    instance::

        S20

    means there is a phosphorylation on Serine at poistion 20 of the protein sequence.
    Possibly, you may have more than one phosphorylation. In order to encode several
    locations, we use the **^** character to represent an **AND**. Mote that
    sometimes a location may be ambiguous. In such case, we use the **+**  character
    to represent an **OR**.

    We use the following conventions.

    #. no spaces
    #. aminod acids are encoded with capitalised letters
    #. S25^T40 means there are 2 psites at position 25 AND 40
    #. S25+S26 means there is an ambiguity and the psite is located at poisiton 25 OR 40
    #. S25+S26^T40 means there are 2 psites, one of which is ambiguous (S25).

    The number of psites is equal to the number of ^ characters plus one.
